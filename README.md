# GD Colon's Next Video tracker
<sub>My first public extension, wow!</sub>

I made this extension *checks last updated code date* 1 year ago because I didn't want to keep going to https://gdcolon.com/nextvideo to check what's his progress with his next video that he's working on... if he's even working on it (you can check that too).

I have removed all references to gdcolon.com, not including the request to check the next video progress.

## Download
