# GD Colon's Next Video tracker
<sub>My first public extension, wow!</sub>

I made this extension *checks last updated code date* 1 year ago because I didn't want to keep going to https://gdcolon.com/nextvideo to check what's his progress with his next video that he's working on... if he's even working on it (you can check that too).

I have removed all references to gdcolon.com, not including the request to check the next video progress.

## Download
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Chrome download link is outdated because Google has to check new versions before you can download them and there is no Firefox download because of the same thing but with Mozilla instead of Google. Untik this information is removed, please manually install the extension.

## Manual install
### Chrome (and Chromium-based browsers)
1. Go to `chrome://extensions` (you need to copy and paste it)
2. Turn on "Developer mode"
3. Download [this .zip file](https://github.com/lower-quality/next-gd-colon-vid/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
4. Make a new folder and unzip it here
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder that you just made

### Firefox
> [!WARNING]  
> You need to do this every time you restart your browser. No idea why, probably for safety.

1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` (you need to copy and paste it)
2. Download [this .zip file](https://github.com/lower-quality/next-gd-colon-vid/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. Make a new folder and unzip it here
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..." and select any file in the folder that you just made

## Privacy Policy
<sub>Google is forcing me to write this</sub>

**The extension doesn't collect data from the user**, BUT if the video is uploaded, **the extension will embed the video and Google WILL collect your data**. I can't really think of a better way to do this without Google collecting your data. [Google's privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

As I mentioned above, the extension does a request to `https://gdcolon.com/nextvideo.json` to check the next video progress. From what GD Colon said to me 1 year ago (I'll try to ask him again to make sure it's still the same), he doesn't collect any data. He also doesn't have any Privacy Policy, because, he would he need one.
